# Grunt Database Migrations

> push/pull databases from one location to another using Grunt. Inspired by https://github.com/getdave/grunt-deployments. At first planned as fork, but later I understand what I want something more than push/pull only mysql databases.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the authors of this Plugin assume **no responsibility** for any actions which result from the usage of this script. You use it entirely *at your own risk*. It is *strongly* recommended that you test the script in a non-critical environment prior to rolling out for production use. *Always* manually backup your local and remote databases before using the script for the first time. No support can be provided for critical situations.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install [-g] grunt-migrations
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-migrations');
```
